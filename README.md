# üè† Homelab

I have been tinkering on networking stuff lately for the purpose of learning and to have my own private server at home since all of the big techs are taking away our privacy especially now with the rise of AI. While doing this, I thought of publishing my journey for future reference and to share it to the community as well.

This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my homelab which is inspired by https://github.com/mischavandenburg/homelab.

## üîß Hardware

### Synology NAS
For the past three years, I've been utilising my Synology NAS as a reliable home server. It efficiently manages and stores all my files and apps, allowing me remote access via the internet and file sharing with family and friends.

- DS420+ with 2.0 GHz CPU, 2GB RAM
- 10TB Seagate SATA Main drive
- 10TB Seagate SATA Backup drive
